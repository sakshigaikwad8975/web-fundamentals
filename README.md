# Web Fundamentals

This repository contains my foundational practice projects in:
- HTML
- CSS
- Basic JavaScript (to be added)

The goal of this repo is to build strong fundamentals in web development
before moving to full-stack development.

Each folder contains small, focused projects created while learning and
refactoring core concepts.
